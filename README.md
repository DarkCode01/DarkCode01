Hi! I'm Jose Segura, a Christian, self-taught fullstack engineer obsessed with bringing software to life that genuinely makes an impact.

<hr />
I love turning ideas into useful tools, especially those that simplify lives (like [regalao.com.do](https://www.regalao.com.do), where I help Dominicans find their ideal car 🚗 by comparing prices in real-time).

#### Technologies that excite me:
- ☁️ AWS Cloud (Certified Practicioner - I love the cloud)
- 📱 Mobile apps with smooth and native experience.
- ⚛️ React & Next.js – Extensive experience creating fast, accessible, and maintainable web interfaces.
- 🧩 Microservices + Clean Architecture – Certified Scalability without chaos.
- 💜 Elixir & Svelte (my current crush! My dream is to lead their community in DR and become a Software Architect).
Open-source, communities, and knowledge sharing are my fuel. Want to talk about collaborating on something cool? Write to me at j0s3s3gur4@gmail.com or connect with me on Linkedin / Github.
