### KLK everyone , I'm jose (miguel) ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cristian Young, a passionate programmer who loves turning ideas into reality through code. Over the past 6 years, I've collaborated on various projects, mainly in the insurance and fintech industries. Most recently, I contributed to the most widely used digital wallet in the Dominican Republic, helping integrate credit card functionality and improve performanceâ€”reaching over 50,000 users. As I always say, languages are just tools; the challenge is knowing when to use them to impact others.
