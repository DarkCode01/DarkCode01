### KLK everyone , I'm jose (miguel) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate and results-driven software engineer with over 5+ years of experience in the field. I have a strong passion for software architecture, and I enjoy contributing to open-source projects. When I'm not coding, you'll often find me playing the guitar. Above all, I'm motivated by my faith and believe in making your ideas come to life through technology.

With a strong foundation in software development, I bring a wealth of experience to the table. I'm dedicated to designing and implementing cutting-edge solutions to address complex technical challenges, with a focus on building scalable and robust applications.
