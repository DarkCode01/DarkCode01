### KLK everyone , I'm jose (miguel) ðŸ‘‹

Currently living in the Dominican Republic, and from this small island, I have managed to collaborate on significant projects as a full-stack developer for over 5 years. What I am most passionate about is not just creating but being able to help others through what I do. As I always say, languages are just tools; the challenge is knowing when to use them to impact others.

With a strong foundation in software development, I bring a wealth of experience to the table. I'm dedicated to designing and implementing cutting-edge solutions to address complex technical challenges, with a focus on building scalable and robust applications.
